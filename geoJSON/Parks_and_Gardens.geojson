In the 1930’s, General Charles S. Farnsworth, a retired war veteran and local resident for whom the park was later named, encouraged and supported the use of the property as a park. In 1931, another distinguished Altadena resident, William D. Davies, for whom the community building was named, organized a board to construct and manage the proposed community building. There were 23 local organizations represented on this “Board of Control.” A board member, Mrs. Thunder went to Washington, D.C. to lobby for government funds for the building. The depression-era agency, Works Progress Administration (WPA), furnished labor using local unemployed, providing jobs and hope for Altadena residents. The beautiful, two-story, stone community building was completed in 1934 and from its perch high in the foothills and visitors can see downtown Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean.

It has plenty of green space for children to run around and it is a very popular place for family picnics. The greenery of the park makes it a perfect place for wedding pictures. The creation of Two Strike Park was the inspiration of Dennis Morgan. He was a popular movie star of the 1940’s and 50’s who, at the time, was La Crescenta’s honorary mayor and was moved by the plight of children who had nowhere to play. He believed that any child who had to play in the street had two strikes against him, and the third strike could be getting hit by a car. Mr. Morgan staged a series of celebrity ball games to raise funds to build Two Strike Park. In 1949, Mr. Morgan representing Two Strike Series, Inc., offered to donate a 5-acre piece of land for the park if the County would purchase an additional 2-acre to complete the parcel. In 1950, the Board of Supervisors responded by adding an area of 3.54-acre.","post_id":"3000163","ext_id":null,"cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"1907325.9303750501","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127703747","longitude":"-118.23507786","point_x":"6490616.4546701303","date_updated":"2018-05-23T15:38:07.000Z","phones":"General: (818) 249-5940;\nReservations: (888) 239-6700","cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":"9:00am - Sunset","info2":null,"addrln1":"5107 Rosemont Ave.","link":"http://egis3.lacounty.gov/parks_lms/?p=3000163","org_name":null,"info1":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.235077914714,34.233190691941]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"city":null,"name":"Joslyn Adult Recreation Center","dis_status":null,"source":"HSIP Freedom Gnis_admin_featu","latitude":"34.099453500000003","zip":null,"email":null,"state":null,"url":null,"cat3":null,"description":null,"post_id":"23282","ext_id":"1763021","cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"1858596.77586506","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127650362","longitude":"-118.1245145","point_x":"6523974.66551264","date_updated":"2010-11-01T19:50:56.000Z","phones":null,"cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":null,"info2":null,"addrln1":null,"link":"http://egis3.lacounty.gov/lms/?p=23282","org_name":"US Geological Survey (USGS) & LA County","info1":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.124514556658,34.099453466508]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"city":"Los Angeles","name":"Glenhurst Park","dis_status":null,"source":"LA City Recreation and Parks","latitude":"34.110289209999998","zip":null,"email":null,"state":"CA","url":null,"cat3":null,"description":null,"post_id":"22864","ext_id":"1732777","cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"1862612.9988037299","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127693933","longitude":"-118.25283506","point_x":"6485136.7330180602","date_updated":"2014-06-09T15:27:29.000Z","phones":null,"cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":null,"info2":null,"addrln1":"2932 Glenhurst Ave","link":"http://egis3.lacounty.gov/lms/?p=22864","org_name":"LA City Department Recreation and Parks","info1":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.252835113163,34.110289178834]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"city":"La Mirada","name":"La Mirada Community Regional Park","dis_status":null,"source":"LA County Department of Parks and Recreation","latitude":"33.909887359999999","zip":"90638","email":null,"state":"CA","url":"http://parks.lacounty.gov/la-mirada-community-regional-park","cat3":null,"description":"La Mirada Community Regional Park is one of the most picturesque parks within the Los Angeles County Park system.

The many equestrians in the area can also find easy access to the Littlerock Community Trail; there is even a hitching post for their convenience.","post_id":"3000105","ext_id":null,"cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"2014667.5726467201","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127703699","longitude":"-117.9668355","point_x":"6571659.0799861401","date_updated":"2018-05-23T14:56:29.000Z","phones":"(661) 944-2988","cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":"Sunrise to Sunset","info2":null,"addrln1":"35548 N. 92 St. East","link":"http://egis3.lacounty.gov/parks_lms/?p=3000105","org_name":null,"info1":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-117.966835556105,34.528373860642]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"city":null,"name":"Anaconda Park","dis_status":null,"source":"HSIP Freedom Gnis_admin_featu","latitude":"33.950568500000003","zip":null,"email":null,"state":null,"url":null,"cat3":null,"description":null,"post_id":"23484","ext_id":"1732088","cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"1804391.4849976499","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127650538","longitude":"-118.0139539","point_x":"6557438.3882832201","date_updated":"2010-11-01T19:50:56.000Z","phones":null,"cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":null,"info2":null,"addrln1":null,"link":"http://egis3.lacounty.gov/lms/?p=23484","org_name":"US Geological Survey (USGS) & LA County","info1":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.013953956659,33.950568466981]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"city":"Los Angeles","name":"Atlantic Avenue Park","dis_status":null,"source":"LA County Department of Parks and Recreation","latitude":"34.0257212","zip":"90022","email":null,"state":"CA","url":"http://parks.lacounty.gov/atlantic-avenue-park","cat3":null,"description":"This small park is inviting for leisure picnics and strolls.

Rocks, located in the high desert near Agua Dulce Springs, features 932 acres of spectacular rock formations, and a seasonal stream. The rocks’ history began in prehistoric times when the sandstone rocks were uplifted at a picturesque angle, showing their jagged red features. In 1874 Tiburcio Vasquez, one of California’s most notorious bandits, used these rocks to elude capture by law enforcement. His name has since been associated with this geologic feature. The park is a popular hiking, picnicking, and equestrian area and has been used in many hit movies, television shows and commercials.","post_id":"3000168","ext_id":null,"cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"2000682.1888721399","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127703751","longitude":"-118.32017899","point_x":"6465191.2794707296","date_updated":"2018-05-23T15:40:14.000Z","phones":"(661) 268-0840","cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":"Sunrise to Sunset;\n8:00am - 7:00pm (May 1 - September 15);\n8:00am - 5:00pm (September 16 - March 9);\n\nNature Center Hours: closed while under construction","info2":null,"addrln1":"10700 W.

Deep River”) was built by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority in 1994. Also known by regulars as “Marrano Beach,” it is used as a recreational area by the local community.\n\nThis beautiful park sits on 12 acres within the 1,492-acre Whittier Narrows Recreation Area. Bosque del Rio Hondo is a lush and wild natural area with excellent bird watching in the riparian wetlands.\n\nThe original San Gabriel Mission was established near this site in 1771, and in 1775 after a flood and fire, the mission was relocated to its present location above the floodplain in today’s City of San Gabriel.\n\nLike other areas behind this flood protection dam, the site features a relatively natural mission creek, which in addition to the Rio Hondo. The site also features seasonal creeks. It is also abundant with wildlife and used by the public for picnics, biking and hiking because it provides access to Rio Hondo and San Gabriel River bicycle paths.","post_id":"3001781","ext_id":null,"cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"1833176.88346347","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127703777","longitude":"-118.068248","point_x":"6540991.59965456","date_updated":"2018-10-23T21:28:55.000Z","phones":null,"cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":"Park Hours: Sunrise to Sunset","info2":null,"addrln1":"9311 San Gabriel Blvd","link":"http://egis3.lacounty.gov/parks_lms/?p=3001781","org_name":null,"info1":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.068248056184,34.029647967164]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"city":null,"name":"Agoura Park","dis_status":null,"source":"HSIP Freedom Gnis_admin_featu","latitude":"34.146394299999997","zip":null,"email":null,"state":null,"url":null,"cat3":null,"description":null,"post_id":"23000","ext_id":"1733439","cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"1876479.1823574","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127650167","longitude":"-118.7395337","point_x":"6337910.6915127197","date_updated":"2010-11-01T19:50:56.000Z","phones":null,"cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":null,"info2":null,"addrln1":null,"link":"http://egis3.lacounty.gov/lms/?p=23000","org_name":"US Geological Survey (USGS) & LA County","info1":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.73953375518,34.146394266356]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"city":"Los Angeles","name":"Occidental Parkway","dis_status":null,"source":"LA City Recreation and Parks","latitude":"34.066078939999997","zip":null,"email":null,"state":"CA","url":"http://laparks.org/dos/parks/parks.htm","cat3":null,"description":null,"post_id":"73911","ext_id":null,"cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"1846548.59523706","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127694401","longitude":"-118.28317468","point_x":"6475907.5766076297","date_updated":"0201-07-02T18:53:23.000Z","phones":null,"cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":null,"info2":null,"addrln1":"Occidental Blvd","link":"http://egis3.lacounty.gov/parks_lms/?p=73911","org_name":"LA City Department of Recreation and Parks","info1":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.283174736393,34.066078906649]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"city":null,"name":"Del Amo Park","dis_status":null,"source":"HSIP Freedom Gnis_admin_featu","latitude":"33.848350199999999","zip":null,"email":null,"state":null,"url":null,"cat3":null,"description":null,"post_id":"23170","ext_id":"1732949","cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"1767295.4666701399","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127650275","longitude":"-118.26229410000001","point_x":"6482024.7297276398","date_updated":"2010-11-01T19:50:56.000Z","phones":null,"cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":null,"info2":null,"addrln1":null,"link":"http://egis3.lacounty.gov/lms/?p=23170","org_name":"US Geological Survey (USGS) & LA County","info1":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.262294156398,33.848350167551]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"city":"Los Angeles","name":"Broadway Park","dis_status":null,"source":"LA City Recreation and Parks","latitude":"33.995457760000001","zip":null,"email":null,"state":"CA","url":"http://laparks.org/dos/parks/parks.htm","cat3":null,"description":null,"post_id":"73905","ext_id":null,"cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"1820844.4530759","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127694395","longitude":"-118.27869693","point_x":"6477192.4552714704","date_updated":"0201-07-02T18:53:23.000Z","phones":null,"cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":null,"info2":null,"addrln1":"5207 S Broadway","link":"http://egis3.lacounty.gov/parks_lms/?p=73905","org_name":"LA City Department of Recreation and Parks","info1":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.278696986258,33.995457726537]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"city":"Los Angeles","name":"Hollenbeck Park","dis_status":null,"source":"LA City Recreation and Parks","latitude":"34.041775000000001","zip":"90033","email":null,"state":"CA","url":"www.laparks.org/dos.htm","cat3":null,"description":"The department provides recreational programs through operation and maintenance of Los Angeles City parks, playgrounds, swimming pools, golf courses and recreation centers.","post_id":"2587","ext_id":null,"cat2":"Parks and Gardens","point_y":"1837653.3918989","use_type":"publish","addrln2":null,"objectid":"127694142","longitude":"-118.21595000000001","point_x":"6496248.3167659603","date_updated":"2014-06-11T09:47:53.000Z","phones":"Service/Intake (323) 261-0113","cat1":"Arts and Recreation","hours":"Monday and Wednseday, 9:00am to 9:30pm; Tuesday and Thursday, 9:00am to 8:00pm; Friday, 9:30am to 10:00pm; Saturday, 9:30am to 6:00pm; Sunday, 10:00am to 5:00pm.

Angeles is named after Helen Keller, who was known as “the first lady of courage”. At the age of 19 months, she lost her sight and hearing because of meningitis but against overwhelming odds, she waged a seemingly impossible battle to re-enter the world she had lost. Helen Keller Park is known for its ability to create new and exciting programs for the community. One of the most popular park programs is the movie screenings sponsored by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts Los Angeles. Over the past seven years, dozens of movies have been shown and many celebrities including “American Idol’s” Nigel Lythgoe, Dewayne “the Rock” Johnson and Happy Days’ Henry Winkler, have visited the park.","post_id":"3000075","ext_id":null,"cat2":"Parks and
